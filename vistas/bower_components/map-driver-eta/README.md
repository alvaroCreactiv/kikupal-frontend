# Map Driver ETA Recipe

Digital cartographers, rejoice! With Lyft's Ride Request API, you can rebuild much of the core functionality found within Lyftâ€™s mobile apps directly in your own application. Check out this Node.js recipe that shows how to surface driver's estimated time of arrival at a location chosen on a map. This application is powered by [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), and our [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/lyft/lyft-node-sdk). 

## Registration
- Create a Lyft Developer [account](https://www.lyft.com/developers).
- Once registered, create a new Lyft [application](https://www.lyft.com/developers/manage).
- Your new application will be assigned a Client ID and a Client Secret.

You will also need to [sign up](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/) for a Mapbox developer account and generate an API key.

## Installation

Install dependencies using npm:
```console
cd map-driver-eta
npm install
```

Set your Lyft Client ID and Client Secret by copying the example file:
```console
cp .env-example .env
```

Set the Mapbox API key in `/public/javascripts/MapComponent.js`:
```console
mapboxgl.accessToken = "YOUR_MAPBOX_API_KEY";
```

Run the app:
```console      
npm start
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to start using the app.
